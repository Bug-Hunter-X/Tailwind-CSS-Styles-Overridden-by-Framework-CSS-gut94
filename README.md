# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js or React.js. The problem arises from the incorrect order of including CSS files, causing the framework's styles to unintentionally override Tailwind's styles.

## Problem

When Tailwind CSS styles are loaded *after* the framework's CSS, the framework's CSS will take precedence. This results in unexpected styling issues, where elements styled with Tailwind classes may appear unstyled or display incorrect styles.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring Tailwind's CSS is loaded *before* the framework's CSS in your project's HTML or build process.  This allows Tailwind's styles to be applied first and prevents overrides by the framework.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if needed).
3. Examine the `bug.js` file (Illustrates the problem) and `bugSolution.js` (Illustrates the correct approach).
