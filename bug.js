This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue.js or React.js. The problem lies in the order of CSS files included. If your framework's CSS (e.g., Vue.js's or React.js's styling) is included after Tailwind CSS, it might unintentionally override Tailwind's styles, causing unexpected visual results. For example, a button styled with Tailwind might lose its default styles and appear plain or unstyled.
